# DaPainter

Personal variation of a mapeditor to be more akin to a simple paint program.
Because one of my colleagues has colorblindness I included sound feature that states color when color is picked.
 
It supports the following features:
- arrow keys to move cursor
- p to toggle paint/erase
- 1 2 3 keys to choose color
- k to save file
- l to load file
