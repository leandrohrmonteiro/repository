# DaPainter

Personal variation of a map editor to be more akin to a simple paint program.
One of my colleagues has color blindness, so I included a sound feature that states the name of the color when one is picked.
 
DaPainter supports the following features:
- arrow keys to move cursor
- p to toggle paint/erase
- 1 2 3 keys to choose color
- k to save file
- l to load file
