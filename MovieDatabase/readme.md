# Movie Database SPA


This spa makes use of the [OMDB api] (http://www.omdbapi.com/) to return movie lists and individual movie info.

### Features:

* Search form
* Hash based non reload view change
* Asynchronous view content injection
* Module MVC architecture


Because this api does cross origin requests on a local level you will run into CORS problem.
To fix that add this extension to your Chrome browser: 
[Web Server for Chrome] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related)
*Start it's local Server using the folder of the Spa as source.
